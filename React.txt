ReactJS is a library
AngularJs is a framework

-->frame work is a collection of libraries.  Ex: AngularJS ,bootstrap, tailwindCSS.

-->library it is collection of methods or function  Ex: Reactjs, jQuery, Node.js,popperJS

-->it is a library
-->it is used to develop a single-page-application
-->it is a component bases application(components are reusable)
-->react is declarative
-->react will renders components on the web-page without page re-loading

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How React Works:

react code---->virtual dom(copy of real dom)--->Virual dom is comparing with real dom(that is one-to-one mapping)

-->react using diffing algorithm
-->react uses a MVC architecture

React uses three dependencies by defaultly
1.react:
 ->createElement,all-hooks

2.react-dom:
 ->used to create virtual Dom

3.react-scipt:
 ->is used to run ,debug, test, eject react-app

-->React was introduced in 2013 ,introduced by facebook(meta) , Jorden walke 
-->latest version using react is react 19

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to Create React Application:

1.CDN way
2.node.js way

 a.npm
   -->is used to install ,update,delete packages in a js.
   -->packages will be installed globally.
   --yarn ,vite 

 EX: npm install -g create-react-app
     create react-app project-name
     npm create vite@latest ----->install the latest version of react

 b.npx:
  -->is used to execute the packages without installing it.
  -->no need of globally while installing packages.

 Ex:
   npx create-react-app project-name
   

Steps to create project:

create folder:
 - open New terminal change to command prompt
 -cd folder name day1
 -npm create vite@latest
 -project name: 
 -select a framework:react
 -select a variant :javascript
 -cd project name
 -npm install
 -npm run dev
 -o

proceed:y
enter the package name: react

--------------------------------------------
React folder Structure:


node-modules folder:-
 --> all the packages and third-party libraries will be present.


src folder:
  --> it is a main folder 
  -->used for creating components.


index.html file:
 -->it is a root file


eslint(ecma script lint):
  -->it is a tool used to debug purpose.

package.json file:-
  -->it stores all dependencies and third party library

README.md file:
  -->it is used for GitHub

babel folder in node_modules:
 -->will convert advanced concept of js to old version of js

----------------------------------------------------------
Components in React:

-->components are basic building blocks in react.
-->components are reusable.

components are two-types:

 1.class based component
 2.function based component / presentational component / dumb component


1.class based component:
 -->it is a es6 class in js.
 -->it uses react-life-cycle.
 -->it is a statefull component(in state by default having state and props)
 -->uses a render() method.
    render() method will renders components on the web-page.
-->it uses a constructor to store data and extends keyword.


import React from 'react'
class demo extends React.Component {
  render(){
     return <h1> I am class based component </h1>
  }
}
export default demo;


2.function based component:
 -->it is javascript pure function.
 -->it does not react-life-cycle.
 -->it doesn't take any render() method.
 -->it is a stateless
    .after react 16.8 function based component  becomes statefull component because of hooks.
 -->there is no constructor and extends in function based component
 

import React from 'react'
function demo(){
  return(
    <h1> function based component <h1>
  )
}
export default demo


import React from 'react'
let  demo=()=> {
  return(
    <h1> function based component <h1>
  )
}
export default demo
